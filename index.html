                Starting a product design course in a pandemic made me want to
                create an app idea that benefits people during these turbulent
                times. It goes without saying that during these times, people
                have become burned out, and mental health has become worse and
                worse. Unfortunately, meeting a counselor is difficult these
                days due to restrictions, and many of the counseling apps
                available do not have a system in place where people can get to
                know the counselor before signing up. Therefore, I wanted to
                develop an app that people can get to know counselors beforehand
                and connect with counselors without the pressure of signing up.
                I was inspired by how influential social media has become in our
                society and applied that idea to a counseling app.
                CounselingConnect is an app where people can get to know
                counselors and therapists on a deeper level while working
                through one‚Äôs problems and issues.

                Domus is a quick and easy way of finding the dream house for
                users. With an intuitive swiping system for users, they can
                easily navigate to find their dream house. While there are
                plenty of blogs and agencies providing information, often,
                buyers new to the market may struggle to get started without
                professional guidance and waste time viewing properties out of
                their range. Domus provides them with the expertise needed to
                get started efficiently.
